This is a project from my Computer Organization and Arcitecture Class


‘The Arduino iPod’ is a combination/push button iPod made from the components in my Arduino Uno kit. The project is a way to store songs with a combination lock and demonstrate my skills as a computer scientist. Consisting of two Pushbuttons, four LED lights, an LCD display, a Piezo, and a Potentiometer, this project plays songs on the piezo and uses the user’s input of a four-pinned combination to unlock the media. My idea for this project was inspired from my phone lock screen. I wanted to replicate a phone lock screen on my iPhone, and use the input from my phone to unlock something using my Arduino Uno. It then morphed into displaying a light show with a combination and then to using a combination to unlock an iPod which plays songs. This project is so cool because it encompasses most of the elements we learned in class and squeezes them together onto two breadboards.
